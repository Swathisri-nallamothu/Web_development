<h1>About Me</h1> 

<p> 
  I am Swathisri. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at '1digitalstack.ai'. I primarily work on web scraping using Python and the Scrapy framework. In addition, I have worked on a few projects where we used Selenium. I have substantial experience building Scrapy crawlers. I completed my education in Information Technology at Bapatla Engineering College, and I am currently working from home.

<p>
  Besides coding, I am interested in how websites work and want to learn more, beyond HTML and CSS which I am already familiar with. I have also enrolled in Angela Yu's Python course. I enjoy her teaching style and the projects she includes, which is why I joined the course.

<p>
  I hope to complete the course and update this by the time I finish.
